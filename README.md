## Configuration

### Network

Some words on networking, since networking is hard.

I decided to build a IPv6 only network (for now) because

-   global IPv4 addresses are expensive to get nowadays
-   it was easier for me to setup (in comparison to NAT in IPv4) and make a clear subnet structure
-   from some ISPs you don't get an IPv4 anymore

I implemented the network with systemd-networkd.

We need to declare our network with the `schallernetz.networking`-option. See [modules/nixos/networking/default.nix](https://github.com/dafitt/schallernetz/blob/main/modules/nixos/networking/default.nix) for available options.

My network options like `schallernetz.networking.domain` or `schallernetz.networking.subnets` must be set the same for every server host in this network. So I would recommend to put those options into a file like e.g. `systems/global-configuration.nix` and im port this file to every server host with `imports = [../../global-configuration.nix];`.

Physical interfaces: Since physical interfaces are always different, it makes no sense to declare them in a module or globally. So they must be declared in [systems/](https://github.com/dafitt/schallernetz/blob/main/systems/). An example:

```nix
systemd.network.networks = {
    "30-enp4s0" = {
        matchConfig.Name = "enp4s0";
        linkConfig.RequiredForOnline = "enslaved";
        vlan = [ "server-vlan" "dmz-vlan" ]; # tagged
        networkConfig = {
            Bridge = "management"; # untagged
            LinkLocalAddressing = "no";
        };
    };
}
```

As you can see, you don't configure the network immediately, you map the network to the interface via vlan or a bridge. If the server needs to be accessable through a network, we need to give the associated bridge the desired static IPv6. Here the host can be accessed through the management network:

```nix
systemd.network.networks = {
    "60-management" = with config.schallernetz.networking.subnets.management; {
      # NOTE completion of bridge
      address = [
        "${uniqueLocal.prefix}***REMOVED_IPv6***/64"
        "***REMOVED_IPv6***/64"
      ];
    };
}
```

The router has of course a more complex bridge configuration. See [systems/x86_64-linux/barebonej3160/default.nix](https://github.com/dafitt/schallernetz/blob/main/systems/x86_64-linux/barebonej3160/default.nix) for an example.

## Usage

### Upgrading

1. At a new NixOS release manually update inputs in [flake.nix](https://github.com/dafitt/schallernetz/blob/main/flake.nix). e.g. `24.05` -> `24.11`.

2. `nix flake update --commit-lock-file`

3. (optional) `nix flake check`, `nix build .#`

4. After that `rebuild test` first and then `switch` for every host.

### Modules

These modules are tested to be imported elsewhere:

```nix
inputs.schallernetz.url = "git+file:../schallernetz?shallow=1";

inputs.schallernetz.nixosModules."systemd/ntfy"
```

## Structure

The flakes structure is similar to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dafitt/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file#structure), but without home-manager.

### Servers

Every service is beeing executed in a seperate [NixOS Container](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_Containers).
